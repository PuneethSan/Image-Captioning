# Image-Captioning
This project is an interesting multi modal topic where we will combine both image and text processing to build a useful Deep Learning application, aka Image Captioning. Image Captioning refers to the process of generating textual description from an image â€“ based on the objects and actions in the image. This project is done using Flicker8k Dataset which has many potential applications in real life.
